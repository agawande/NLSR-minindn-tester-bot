# Patches that are open, belong to project NLSR, are mergable, and have been verified by jenkins
# In the logic need to store the patch id and check if already reviewed by nlsr-tester - need to get patch no.
# Need to save patch number

1) Get a list of NLSR patches that are open, belong to project NLSR, are mergable, and have been verified by jenkins:

   GET gerrit.named-data.net/changes/?q=status:open+project:NLSR+reviewedby:jenkins+is:mergeable+label:verified


2) Get detail so as to get the latest patch-number

   If(change-id and current patch has not already been commented on by self) {
     GET gerrit.named-data.net/changes/myProject~branch~changeId/detail HTTP/1.0

     Save that change-id
   } else {
     if(changeId has been merged - remove from the file)
     Go to step 9
   }

3) Get the current patch set in zip form (Test download commands with authentication)

   GET gerrit.named-data.net/changes/myProject~master~I8473b95934b5732ac55d26311a706c9c2bde9940/revisions/current/patch?zip HTTP/1.0

   (GET gerrit.namd-data.net/changes/NLSR~master~<change-Id>/revisions/current/patch HTTP/1.0)

4) Unzip the patch set
   !!CHECK IF ANY REAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE CPP< HPP FILES, IGNORE COMMENTS ADDED ETC!!
   mv pathc.zip changeId.zip
   unzip changeId.zip --> <sample>.diff
   
5) update ndn-cxx, NFD, and install
   go to NLSR
   git checkout -b test-<changeId>
   git apply <sample>.diff
   install NLSR

6) Run various tests using minindn, collect results

7) Post comment on gerrit with list of results - which passed, which failed

8) Clean everything
   cd NLSR
   git stash
   git checkout master
   git branch -D test-<changeId>

9) Sleep 15 minutes

10) Go to step 1
